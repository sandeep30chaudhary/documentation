# Typsy Web Player
It’s possible to embed Typsy Lessons into an external website through the use of the ‘Typsy Web Player’.

The Typsy Player returns an HTML page which is typically embedded into an external system using an iFrame or through launching a new browser window or tab.

The Typsy Player requires certain information passed to it in the URL for authentication and to identify the user.  The Typsy Player tracks all viewing information to the Typsy System. Should the user or manager wish to, they can login and see their statistics.
